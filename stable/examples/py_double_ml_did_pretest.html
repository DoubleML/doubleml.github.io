You can find further references and a detailed guide on pre-testing with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">did</span></code>-package at the <a class="reference external" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/did/vignettes/pre-testing.html">did-package

<p>At first, we will generate some data to evaluate the corresponding effect estimates. The DGP is slightly adjusted from <a class="reference external" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/did/vignettes/pre-testing.html">did-package pre-testing documentation</a> to consider conditional non-linear parallel trends.</p>
<p>We will consider <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{obs}=1000\)</span> units for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2n_t\)</span> time periods <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\in\{-n_t, .., n_t - 1\}\)</span>, where the treatment is applied just before <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>. The data generating process will take the following form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Y_{it} = \theta_t + \eta_i + D_{i}\mu_{it} + g(X_{it}) + \epsilon_{it}.\]</div>
<p>Here <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta_t = t\)</span> denotes a time fixed effect, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span> is a unit fixed effect, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_{it}\sim\mathcal{N}(0, I_4)\in \mathbb{R}^4\)</span> denote ‘pre-treatment’ covariates for the time period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_{it}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\)</span> are independent error terms. Further, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_{it} \sim \mathcal{N}(\tau,1)\)</span> denote time varying individual effects with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau = (\underbrace{0,\dots,0}_{n_t\ times}, n_t, \dots, 1)^T\)</span> beeing the average effects
(coinciding with the ATTE since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_{it}\)</span> is independent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span>.) The treatment indicator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{i}\)</span> denotes whether unit <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> was treated between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=-1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> and is generated as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align*}
f_{ps}(X) &amp;= 0.75\cdot(-X_1 + 0.5X_2 - 0.25X_3 - 0.1X_4X_3 + \cos(5X_2))\\
D_{i} &amp;= \frac{\exp(f_{ps}(X_{i0}))}{1+\exp(f_{ps}(X_{i0}))}
\end{align*}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Finally, the direct effect of the covariates is given via</p>
