The company offers solutions and software implementations for industry use cases by integrating and developing state-of-the-art researches methods of causal inference. Together with the developers of the DoubleML it offers trainings and workshops on causal machine learning.\nDoubleML is an open-source software for Python and R offering tools for causal machine learning. In our package, we implement the double/debiased machine learning approach by Chernozhukov et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChernozhukov, Victor, Denis Chetverikov, Mert Demirer, Esther Duflo, Christian Hansen, Whitney Newey, and James Robins. 2018. “Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters.” The Econometrics Journal 21 (1): C1–68. https://doi.org/10.1111/ectj.12097."

    "text": "Join our trainings to get started with Causal Machine Learning. Our courses are adressed to data scientists at industry and research at all technical levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrations are open now\n\n\n\n\nCheck our upcoming classes\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Course\nWe offer an intensive two-days training on Causal Machine Learning with DoubleML open for dat scientists at all technical levels. On Day 1, we will start with the basics of Causal Machine Learning and get to know the basics of Double Machine Learning. On Day 2, we cover more advanced topics of Causal Machine Learning, including more advanced causal models, quasi-experimental appraoches like Difference-in-Differences and Sensitivity Analysis.\nEach day provides:\n\nAn Introduction to the theoretical basis and advanced topics of Causal Machine Learning, and,\nHands-on sessions based on real-data use cases.\n\n\n\nSmall Classes, Big Impact\nWe teach our classes to small groups. We currently accept 20 registrations for each workshop. Moreover, in our hands-on sessions, we make sure that there are study groups of 7 participants managed by one instructor. In dedicated sessions, you will have planty of time to ask questions and discuss open points.\n\n\nLearn from the People behind the DoubleML Library\nOur trainings are offere by members of the core DoubleML developer team in collaboration with our partners from EconomicAI. Find out more about our instructors.\n\n\nTopics Covered\nWe will cover the following topics:\n\n\n\nDay 1: Basics of Causal ML\n\nBasics of Causality and Causal Machine Learning\nIntroduction to Double Machine Learning\nHands-on Sessions and Q & A in small groups (max. 7 persons)\n\n\n\nDay 2: Advanced Topics\n\nOverview: Causal Models and Extensions\nDifference-in-Differences\nSensitivity Analysis\nHands-on Sessions and Q & A in small groups (max. 7 persons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Access to Resources\nAll teaching materials will be shared during and after the workshop, including slides and Python notebooks from the hands-on sessions.\n\n\nWhy Causal Machine Learning?\nMachine Learning has revolutionized the world. In most cases, ML method have been used for prediction purposes. However, the most important questions are causal. Managers wonder if a certain service is profitable or not…\n\n\nWhat is Double Machine Learning?\nDouble Machine Learning is a general approach to Causal Machine Learning. All ML algorithms introduce some form of regularization in order to handle complex or high-dimensional data. Double Machine Learning explicitly addresses the consequences of such a regularization in the context of causal inference. It is based on three key ingredients:\n\nNeyman Orthogonality\nHigh-Quality ML Learners\nSample Splitting (a.k.a. Cross-Fitting)\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious? Check out the upcoming classes and join our trainings to learn more!"
