    "text": "Our trainings are provided in collaboration with our partners from EconomicAI.\n\nEconomicAI\nEconomicAI is a start-up founded by a group of leading researchers in the field of causal machine learning. The company offers solutions and software implementations for industry use cases by integrating and developing state-of-the-art researches methods of causal inference. Together with the developers of the DoubleML it offers trainings and workshops on causal machine learning. EconomicAI has a network of partners, who are top-level researchers and practitioners and leaders in the field of econometrics, machine learning, mathematical statistics, and operations research. They work as professors at Harvard University, University of Hamburg, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, Hong Kong University, New York University, and Duke University. The partners have extensive publication records and are winners of major academic awards and have completed projects with Microsoft, Amazon.com, State Street Corporation, Tata, DIDI, and others.\n\n\nDoubleML\nDoubleML is an open-source software for Python and R offering tools for causal machine learning. In our package, we implement the double/debiased machine learning approach by Chernozhukov et al. (2018), which offers a framework for valid statistical inference in a variety of causal models including for example (partially) linear regression models, IV models, Difference-in-Differences models and nonparametric models for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects. For more information on the package, visit the DoubleML website and the accompanying publications in Bach et al. (2022) and Bach et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBach, Philipp, Victor Chernozhukov, Sven Klaassen, Malte S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Join our trainings to get started with Causal Machine Learning. Our courses are open to data scientists from industry and academia at all technical levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrations are open now\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our upcoming classes!\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Course\nWe offer an intensive two-day training on Causal Machine Learning with DoubleML for data scientists at all technical levels. On Day 1, we will start with the basics of Causality and Causal Machine Learning and introduce you to the fundamentals of Double Machine Learning. On Day 2, we cover more advanced topics of Causal Machine Learning, including more elaborate causal models, quasi-experimental approaches like Difference-in-Differences, and Sensitivity Analysis.\nEach day provides:\n\nAn introduction to the theoretical basis of Causal/Double Machine Learning\nHands-on sessions based on real-data use cases\nDedicated Q&A sessions\n\nOur classes are taught by members of the DoubleML developer team and organized by Economic AI.\n\n\nSmall Classes, Big Impact\nWe teach our classes to small groups. We currently accept 20 registrations for each workshop. Moreover, in our hands-on sessions, we make sure that there are study groups of at most 7 participants managed by one instructor. In dedicated sessions, you will have planty of time to ask questions and discuss open points.\n\n\nLearn from the People behind the DoubleML Library\nLearn from the members of the core DoubleML developer team. Our classess are offered in collaboration with our partners from EconomicAI. Economic AI is a start-up that has specialized in transferring Causal Machine Learning approaches to industry use cases. Find out more about our instructors.\n\n\nTopics Covered\nThe will cover the following topics:\n\n\n\nDay 1: Basics of Causal ML\n\nBasics of Causality and Causal Machine Learning\nIntroduction to Double Machine Learning\nHands-on Sessions and Q&A in small groups (max. 7 persons)\n\n\n\nDay 2: Advanced Topics\n\nOverview: Causal Models and Extensions\nDoubleML for Difference-in-Differences\nSensitivity Analysis with DoubleML\nHands-on Sessions and Q&A in small groups (max. 7 persons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-on Sessions and Data Examples\n\nParticipants will gain practical experience with Double Machine Learning in dedicated hands-on sessions with topics from various domains (see examples above).\n\n\nFull Access to Resources\nAll teaching materials will be shared during and after the workshop, including slides and Python notebooks from the hands-on sessions.\n\n\nWhy Causal Machine Learning?\nMachine Learning has revolutionized the world. In most cases, ML method have been used for prediction purposes. However, the most important questions are causal. Managers wonder if a certain service is profitable or not, whether certain production processes improve the quality of the final product and how to optimally allocate resources. Causal Machine Learning makes it possible to combine the predictive power of ML algorithms with causal modelling.\n\n\nWhat is Double Machine Learning?\nDouble Machine Learning is a general approach to Causal Machine Learning. In short, all ML algorithms introduce some form of regularization in order to handle complex or high-dimensional data. Double Machine Learning explicitly addresses the consequences of such a regularization in the context of causal inference. It is based on three key ingredients:\n\nNeyman Orthogonality\nHigh-Quality ML Learners\nSample Splitting (a.k.a. Cross-Fitting)\n\nAs a result, Double Machine Learning offers inference procedures like valid statistical tests based on estimation with ML.\n\n\n\n\nCurious? Check out the upcoming classes and join our trainings to learn more!\n\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have questions, have a look at our FAQs or contact us via trainings@economicai.com."
