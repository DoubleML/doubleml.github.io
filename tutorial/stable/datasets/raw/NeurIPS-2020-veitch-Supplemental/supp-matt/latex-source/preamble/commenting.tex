%% NA: needs attention (rough writing whose correctness needs to be verified)
%% TBD: instructions for how to fix a gap ("Describe the propagation by ...")
%% PROBLEM: bug or missing crucial bit 

%% use \fXXX versions of these macros to put additional explanation into a footnote.  
%% The idea is that we don't want to interrupt the flow of the paper or make it 
%% impossible to read because there are a bunch of comments.

%% NA's (and TBDs, those less crucially) should be written so 
%% that they flow with the text.
