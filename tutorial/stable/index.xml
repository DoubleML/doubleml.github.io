      <description>DoubleML - Double Machine Learning in R The R package DoubleML provides an implementation of the double / debiased machine learning framework of Chernozhukov et al.Â (2018). It is built on top of mlr3 and the mlr3 ecosystem (Lang et al., 2019).
Note that the R package was developed together with a python twin based on scikit-learn. The python package is also available on GitHub and PyPI version.
