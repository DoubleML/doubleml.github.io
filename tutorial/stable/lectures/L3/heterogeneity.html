<li><p>In many cases, treatment effects are <strong>heterogeneous</strong> across individuals</p></li>
<li><p>Think of the effect of a training program on wages:</p>

<li>The effect is likely to be different for individuals who participate in the program and those who do not</li>
<li>Usually, the goal is not to force everyone to do training programs</li>

<li><p>Heterogeneity is of interest in many applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effect of a marketing campaign on different types of customers (uplift modeling, e.g., different markets, different age groups, etc.)</li>
